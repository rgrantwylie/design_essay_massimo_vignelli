             <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <br>
              <p>For this essay, I chose to focus on the famous designer Massimo Vignelli, from Italy – who spent over a decade in academic education studying architecture, and would go on to put his mark on the design world and in particular, the United States of America.
The purpose of this essay is to explore as to whether Massimo Vignelli is in fact, the world’s most influential timeless designer. In his words, the life of a designer is to remove the ‘vulgarity’ of design from the world and also, “If you do it right, it will last forever”. I am going to focus on Vignelli himself and explore his views on the design world, his principles in pursuit of timeless design and whether his work stacked up to his vision; I shall also compare him to other designers and the trends of his time. 
This essay will contain images of his work and others when necessary.
</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>But First… What is Timeless? </b></p>
              <br>
              <p>Before jumping in, it would be a good idea to first of all have an understanding of what constitutes to being timeless. Some key characteristics include:</p>
<br>
    <ul>
<li>Ageless</li>
<li>Permanent</li>
<li>Everlasting</li>
<li>Classic</li>
<li>Durable</li>
<li>Adaptable</li>
<li>Functional</li>

<li>Has origins</li>
<li>Aesthetic</li>
<li>Understandable / clear</li>
     </ul>
              <br>
       <p>As you can see, the point of being timeless is that it is here to stay, it’s not going anywhere. It has a relevance that validates its acceptance years ago, yesterday, today, tomorrow and in years to come. Timeless design is clear & understandable, whether you see it on a magazine, a store, clothing or anything, you instantly recognize that design, you know who it belongs to. If you see something similar, you associate it to that design, a clear identity will last for a very long time and will not need to change.
<br>
Some examples of timeless design include:</p>

 <br>
              
 <p>When it comes to Massimo Vignelli, whichever category of design he focused in, one of his ultimate goals was for the design to be timeless. So, did everything about Vignelli streamline towards what could lead to timeless designs? I’m going to dissect his profile plus his work, and compare & contrast with other designers & design during those periods.

             <h3>His Views</h3>
             <br>
             <p>Throughout Massimo Vignelli’s career, he wasn’t afraid to speak his mind about design, and as the book <b><em>‘Lella and Massimo Vignelli – Two Lives, One Vision’</em></b> by <em>Jan Conradi</em> explains, the Vignelli’s advocated for the power of design by their actions, their own work, via interviews & public statements, through writing articles and sometimes through consultation. Vignelli had a vision: to make the world a better place, fight ignorance, create understanding, adding beauty, meaning and elegance to the artefacts of everyday life.
</p>
             <br>
             
             <p><b>Marketing, Market Research & Customers’ Needs</b></p>
             <br>
             <p>In an article in <em>brainpickings.org</em>, Vignelli rejected focus groups and also encouraged people not to let their ‘limited beliefs’ shrink the boundaries of the possible:
</p><br>
             <blockquote>“I don’t believe in market research. I don’t believe in marketing the way it’s done in America. The American way of marketing is to answer to the wants of the customer instead of answering to the needs of the customer. The purpose of marketing should be to find needs — not to find wants.
People do not know what they want. They barely know what they need, but they definitely do not know what they want. They’re conditioned by the limited imagination of what is possible. … Most of the time, focus groups are built on the pressure of ignorance.”
<br>
<cite>Source: brainpickings.org</cite>
</blockquote>
             <br>
             <p>In that same interview, Vignelli said:
</p><br>
                <blockquote>“Marketing people look down to people. Instead, a good designer or a good, responsible client looks up to people. … One has to believe in the redeeming factor of education, in the redeeming factor of not spreading vulgarity. … Commercial things are done by people that want to exploit other people and couldn’t care less about quality. We are interested [in] quality. … Nobility is our life — isn’t that great?”

<br>
<cite>Source: brainpickings.org</cite>
</blockquote><br>
             <p>Massimo was a visionary. With his modernist approach, he felt that the world could be improved under his image of good design. He was never enthusiastic about the business side of the design industry; he had always focused more on the design aspect of the design industry.

Vignelli rejected trends as he felt they didn’t represent good, consistent, timeless design. He mentioned about marketing people looking down on people, you could argue that Vignelli’s design principles and view of customers don’t know what they need, let alone want, sounds a bit like people looking up to his knowledge, but he did also mention that good designers look up to people. If you want to produce timeless design, then you need to stick to principles that can result to that.
I do believe that the voice of the consumer is important and it is up to you if you see a way that is genuinely more beneficial to their needs then you should present it to them. Vignelli mentioned about educating yourself on design so you can produce quality, and that people involved in commercial aspects aim to exploit people, and aren’t concerned about quality, which of course Vignelli considered vulgar. I can understand where Vignelli was coming from although I wouldn’t suggest that all commercial industries don’t care about quality, but commercial industries can run on trends, which of course doesn’t equate to timelessness.
</p>
             <br>
             <p><b>Typography</b></p>
             <br>
             <p>Massimo Vignelli had a strong regard for quality type and its origins, he also had a strong disregard for desktop published typefaces. In the book <b><em>‘The Vignelli Canon’</em></b>, Vignelli said “typography should not be used as an expression of the self” and believed that “most typefaces were created for commercial reasons”. On the basis of timelessness, I can understand this. When you see a load of desktop-published typefaces they don’t strike out to you that they’re going to be synonymous or recognized in say a couple of centuries time. In my own personal view, however, when done well I’m for typography being used for expression and I do think depending on the circumstances doing so can be quite important, when you look at the likes of <em>Paula Scher</em> & <em>Wolfgang Weingart</em> for instance, they’re very experimental with type and it looks fantastic.
<em>Paula Scher</em> also rejects that design is timeless, as she once said in an interview:
</p><br>
               <blockquote>“You never can do what the kids do. What you do is look at yourself and find your own way to address the fact that the times have changed and that you have to pay attention. You can’t be a designer and say, “Oh, this is timeless.” Nothing is timeless!”


<br>
<cite>Source: Interview</cite>
</blockquote><br>
             <p>This isn’t about whether timelessness exists but I think as time goes on, this debate will continue and will grow even bigger.
<br>
Vignelli also explained that he relied on half a dozen typefaces. These included:
</p>
             
<ul>
             
<li>Garamond</li>
<li>Bodoni</li>
<li>Century Expanded</li>
<li>Helvetica</li>
<br>
     <p>Other fonts mentioned were:
</p>        
     <br>
    <li>Optima</li>
<li>Futura</li>
<li>Univers</li>
<li>Caslon</li>
<li>Baskerville</li>
             </ul>
             <br>
             <p>Going back in design history will show you that these typefaces were created numerous centuries ago, with Helvetica being one of the most recent in 1957, Optima 1955, Univers in 1954 & Futura in 1927.
<br><br>
There is proof that companies revert back to original typefaces, some of these include:
</p>
             
             <img src="images/waterstones_logo.png" alt="Waterstones logo"/><br>
<p>Figure 5 - Waterstones - Baskerville</p>
<img src="images/vogue_logo.png" alt="Vogue logo"/><br>
<p>Figure 6 - Vogue - Bodoni</p>
<img src="images/jeep_logo.png" alt="Jeep logo"/><br>
<p>Figure 7 - Jeep – Helvetica</p>
             <br>
             <br>
             
             <p>These are not the only examples. Helvetica has been the type choice for many brands and was one of Vignelli’s favourites.
<br><br>
                 Vignelli is not alone in regards to the usage of original typefaces. Famous designer <em>Paul Rand</em>, in an interview published in <em>Type Talks</em>, back in Autumn 1989, said:
</p>
             <br>
               <blockquote>“When one considers the wonderful old faces that have passed through the sieve of time, one wonders, why new faces! Unless they’re really new, there seems to be no reason to add to an already overloaded stockpile”.

<br>
<cite>Source: paul-rand.com	Published in “Type Talks”, Fall 1989.
</cite>
</blockquote><br>
             <p>As Vignelli had said himself, loads of typefaces are designed as a remake of the originals and doesn’t find them beneficial. A trait of timelessness is durability and typographic remakes and desktop-published ones could be up against it to make it into that category.
</p><br>
             <p><b>Rule of Design Is Above Everything / Global Visual Language
</b></p><br>
             <p>This can be a tricky one, depending how you go about it. In an interview with <em>Debbie Millman</em> back on 2012, Vignelli spoke about design in countries such as China, India & Japan, stating that despite this global visual language, these countries with different cultures will find their own way in the ‘global culture’ of design. He said rules of design are above all – geography, fashion, trends.
Amongst this, Vignelli explained how modernism is not a style, but instead an attitude of approaching reality, and how it’s positive, constructive and long-lasting; he concluded that modernism is appropriate in the likes of India. 
<br><br>
I think it is important to point out that Vignelli was not religious, and you could argue that it was easier for him to state certain things, but what my studying of design has told me, unless I’m wrong, is that regardless of culture, the design principles remain a similar process. Colour theory will tell you that the meanings in the West are different to the meanings in the East, for instance, but the design principles are similar, you go with what’s appropriate.
<br><br>
The relation with timelessness is that you work with the rules of design - this global visual language – goes above any design trend and can be used anywhere in the world, with of course the respected cultural versions, which I believe is so imperative to be respected.
<br><br>
Vignelli believed good design is “ubiquitous and forever”, and advocated that the rule of design in the educational process should be about structure, and not about trends.
The best way to know if Vignelli’s design principles are the necessary ingredients towards timeless design, is to look further into them.

             <h3>His Principles</h3>
             <br>
             <p>In the book The <b><em>'Vignelli Canon'</em></b>, he outlined what he described as the ‘intangibles’ and ‘tangibles’ of good design. Listing them quickly, the intangibles are: semantics, syntactics, pragmatics, discipline, appropriateness, ambiguity, design is one, visual power, intellectual elegance, timelessness, responsibility & equity.
The ‘tangibles’ were: paper size, grids / margins / columns & modules, a company letterhead, typefaces – the basic ones, flush left, centered & justified, rulers, contrasting type sizes, scale, texture, colour, layouts, sequence, binding, identity & diversity & white space. I am going to group some of the intangibles as I explain how these can equate to timeless design.
</p>
             <br>
        <p><b>The Intangibles
</b></p>
             <hr>
             <p><b>Semantics, syntactics, pragmatics

</b></p>
            <br>
             <p>These are three things Vignelli said are the most important aspects.	 Semantics is about searching for meaning, for the purpose of design it’s about understanding the project and also its history. Going back to the list of characteristics that apply to timelessness, one of those is about origins. What’s its background? What do they / it represent? These are important parts to understanding the history of something. It gives you a platform to work on, and this is really important. 
Syntactics is like using the correct usage of language, and in design this relates to design principles, using various aspects appropriately to produce the required message. As Vignelli said, good design lasts a very long time, good design consists of the correct use of design principles. He mentions in his book the ‘recipes’ of syntactical design – such as the grid, typefaces, type, headlines, illustration. 
Pragmatics is about going through something logically, and as Vignelli put it, it is the clarity of the semantics and the syntax. It’s bringing together the understanding of the focus in-hand and combining that with the correct use of the ‘design language’.
<br><br>
Functional is a characteristic of timelessness and I believe these three ‘intangibles’ together fit into a functional system that results in good design. Let’s move on to the next aspects.
</p><br>
             <p><b>Appropriateness, equity, responsibility, timelessness
</b></p><br>
             <p>I felt inclined to leave timelessness out of this as that is the focal point of the essay, but as it’s included I decided maybe it was best to keep it in. I categorized these four together as I felt these represented an understanding of the focus, the ‘sensitivities’ and importance of various aspects in design. Appropriateness fits under the ‘sensitives’ bracket for me as it signifies your awareness of what is acceptable and what is not. Vignelli put it as the “defining of the area of possible solutions that are appropriate”.
In regards to equity, Vignelli regarded logos as an entity that should be protected, like a landmark - a unanimous symbol that everybody recognizes, and shouldn’t be completely rebranded every so often, which of course goes against the meaning of timelessness.
Vignelli described responsibility as ‘economics awareness towards the most appropriate solution to a given problem’. This can branch out to other forms of design but for someone in the industry this is sensible advice.
Timelessness – the focal point of this essay – is about long-lasting design, not about trends. Vignelli also pointed out to primary shapes and colours as an inclusion of origins.
<br><br>
I would say the majority of the timeless traits are valid for these aspects. It’s about durability, everlasting and in the sense of logo design, can become a classic.
</p><br>
             <p><b>Discipline, intellectual elegance, visual power, design is one, ambiguity
</b></p><br>
             <p>For me these aspects are about higher understanding of design, and for the likes of intellectual elegance, that’s how Vignelli defined that. Again, Vignelli’s belief in the statement ‘design is one’ (meaning ‘if you can design one thing, you can design anything’), goes broader than this purpose of graphic design orientation, and is perhaps a whole new argument. Vignelli said he liked a certain amount of ambiguity, if done right, can result to various meanings. I find this a little contradictory to some of the earlier principles, such as the semantics, syntactics and pragmatics. Clarity of these are important, and in my opinion, ambiguity works better in art instead of design, and I’d prefer to stay clear of it as much as possible. Visual power, according to Vignelli, is about the syntactical usage of typography, such as bold type among lighter type, large headings. I was initially confused by Vignelli’s belief in typefaces not showing expression but advocating the likes of large titles, but I have grasped clarity into what he meant, and I now understand. The most important skill in my opinion, for the importance of consistency and more, is discipline. It is what the best designers or anyone in a certain field requires.
<br><br>
To me discipline & intellectual elegance is important to contributing to timeless design. It involves required skill and understanding / knowledge to know what you are doing.
<br><br>
In regards to the ‘tangibles’ listed by Vignelli, these are imperative ‘tools’ that you use together with the ‘traits’ from the ‘intangibles’ and together I feel can result in successfully good and timeless design.
<br><br>
It’s all well and good having this plethora of ‘traits and tools’, but it’s about putting them into practice. In the final chapter I am going to go through Vignelli’s work and decide whether he lived up to his own views and principles.

             <h3>His Work</h3>
             <br>
             <p>Vignelli designed many-a-things, whilst he was at Unimark, and at Vignelli Associates, including logos, posters, signage, and crossed into other areas of design, including architecture and fashion. I am going to go through three pieces of work that stand out for me from Vignelli’s portfolio, and they are the logos of American Airlines & Ford, plus the map designed for the New York subway. These three pieces of work had their own share of success, competition, criticism and in some regards, rejection – in the notion of timelessness. I am going to explore these pieces of work and whether they lived up to Vignelli’s views, his principles and the main focal point of this essay – timelessness.
</p><br>
             <p><b>Ford</b></p>
             <br>
             <p>In 1966, Ford were the first big client to go under the wing of Vignelli’s Unimark design company, beating many major design firms for the motor company’s needs of an identity shakeup, such as <em>Murtha</em> and <em>Paul Rand</em>. Their problem was the logo had different variations in global sites, their factories and their showrooms, they needed a unified image. In the book <b><em>'Unimark International'</em></b> by <em>Jan Conradi</em>, it explains the presentations that happened between <em>Paul Rand</em> and Vignelli of then Unimark:
</p><br>
              <blockquote>“Graphic identification was viewed more as artistic embellishment that functional necessity. The world was flooded with ‘heavied up’ scripts, fancy frills and shapely frames… If one were to choose but one flaw (of the then logo) it would be that it is incongruous in point of time with its environment… The oval shape in which the signature is focused is not distinctive; it is merely another oval which is not unique to any one time or period”

<p>Figure 8 - Paul Rand’s proposed logo for Ford Motor Company</p>
             <br>
             <p>Vignelli took a different approach, instead defending the logo and dismantling Rand’s view by explaining that the script and oval of the logo was only behind Coca-Cola in terms of the most recognized symbol in the United States.
</p>
             <img src="images/ford_logo.png" alt="Ford logo"/><br>

             <br>
             <p>As Unimark got stuck in to the Ford project, they developed an identity system, modular signage elements and educated the clients in order to keep them in line with Unimark’s vision.
<br><br>
This goes back to the characteristics of timelessness. Origins can be so important for an identity, it gives it a background, a history and a sense of meaning. It’s also understandable. Once you see the words you recognize it straight away, it’s unified in acknowledgment by people all around the world. To this day the logo is still intact, apart from commercial visual effects that you see. A logo that is long-lasting and isn’t in a regular need of change, that is timeless.
</p><br>
             <p><b>American Airlines
</b></p><br>
             <p>Whilst at Unimark in 1967, Vignelli took the forefront of the project to redesign the American Airlines logo. As Vignelli stated in the book – <b><em>The Vignelli Canon</em></b>, he preferred to stick to primary aspects, the origins, as much as possible, including colour palette; consisting of red, blue and yellow. By these principles, it’s no surprise, and understandable, that Vignelli went with red and blue text, representing the colours of the United States. A secondary was also created with two ‘a’s. There was fierce rejection led by flight attendants, as Unimark’s proposal excluded the brand’s landmark eagle. It should be said that this went against Vignelli’s principle in maintaining equity. Vignelli would reluctantly go ahead with the inclusion of an eagle, designed by <em>Henry Dreyfuss</em>.
<br><br>
The logo lasted until 2013, over 40 years. When it was changed in 2013, Vignelli had said the typeface wasn’t as powerful, the eagle didn’t look definite and that the company made a mistake in believing that the brand identity was damaged because the business side was faltering.
</p><br>
             <img src="images/american_arlines_logos.png" alt="Massimo Vignelli's old and American Airlines new logo"/><br>
<p>Figure 10 - Massimo Vignelli’s Unimark design to American Airlines rebrand from 2013</p>
             <br>
             <p>Marketing is prominent in the design industry and tend to think a rebrand is like keeping up with the times, trends. Companies want a brand that speaks out to their audience, which can sometimes change, but ultimately this doesn’t guarantee timelessness design. 
<br><br>
Was Vignelli’s logo timeless? In design terms, 40+ years is a long time, and if American Airlines stuck with Vignelli’s, who knows how much longer it would’ve lasted. 
</p><br>
             <p><b>New York Subway Map
</b></p><br>
             <p>Vignelli’s design principles would be tested as he was asked by the MoMA to redesign the New York subway map in 1972.
</p><br>
             <img src="images/new_york_subway_map.png" alt="Massimo Vignelli's New York subway map"/><br>
<p>Figure 11 - Massimo Vignelli’s New York subway map in 1972</p>
             <br>
             <p>Sticking to his principles, Vignelli used basic geometrical shapes throughout the map, which was formal and abstract. The map contained the main stops and simplified the colour coding; it would represent similarities to <em>Henry C. Beck’s</em> 1931 map of the London Underground. However, all this would not go down well with passengers. The streamlined design made it confusing for people to understand. They got mixed up with the real geography of the city compared to the simplified shape used on the map; Central Park wouldn’t be geometrically correct, for instance. The routes also wouldn’t be exact as each would be either 45 or 90 degrees. Overall, Vignelli oversimplified it. It didn’t go down well and was subsequently replaced in 1979.
<br><br>
This was one of Vignelli’s more difficult projects. You could argue that Vignelli betrayed the tradition of the map by going contemporary and you could also say the components were too many for Vignelli’s principles to successfully tie everything in into a functional and appropriate design. The principle of minimalism is to maintain only the components that make the whole function. Perhaps, in the case of large cities, minimalist maps don’t work.
<br><br>
This wasn’t the only transportation project Vignelli had worked on. He also worked for the National Park Service, using the unigrid; it is still used today.

             <p>The purpose of this essay was to paint an overall image of Vignelli, using his views, design principles and the success of his work to define whether he was the ‘ultimate timeless designer’.
<br><br>
The problem with defining something as timeless is that you can’t predict the future, in that sense does timelessness even exist? My view on it is that if something has lasted a long, long, long time, and is still present now, then currently it is timeless.
<br><br>
For me to get this image of Vignelli, I needed to see his views, which he wasn’t short of. Also, I wanted to see if his principles complemented the characteristics of timelessness, and a bit like Vignelli’s definition of pragmatics, if, the first two worked together, did is stack up to his work?
In regards to his views, he spoke of his rejection of market research, and the customers not knowing what they need, in regards to design. Commercial industries follow trends, so in that sense I can understand Vignelli’s perception of marketing. Timelessness rejects trends. He explained how he preferred to stick to more original fonts, that had a background, and rejected desktop published fonts, so again, I feel this is appropriate for the purpose of timelessness, and also he spoke of how design principles are global, but cultures can have their own variations. I can understand his meaning behind this, but again, for the purpose of timelessness, I feel this depends on the design principles.<br>
I categorized his design ‘intangibles’ into categories and related them to characteristics. For instance, I felt semantics, syntactics & pragmatics fitted into the category of ‘functional, for appropriateness, equity, responsibility, timelessness, I felt this fit into certain categories such as durability, everlasting and even classic. The remaining aspects - Discipline, intellectual elegance, visual power, design is one, ambiguity. As I said, I felt discipline & intellectual elegance are important to contributing to timeless design. It involves required skill and understanding / knowledge to know what you are doing. So, all in all, I would say the majority of these aspects are appropriate for the purpose of timelessness. With his views and design principles stacked up, it was down to whether his work lived up to the billing.<br>
Workwise, he was part of a design firm that designed a company logo 50 years ago and is still prominent as ever today, for design, that is a long time, and I think for the purpose of timelessness, I think you have to consider it timeless. The American Airlines logo lasted over 45 years, only to be (perhaps controversially) replaced in 2013. Vignelli of course disagreed and gave his reasons, and I have to admit, I wouldn’t disagree with his views, so who knows how long it would’ve lasted. When you see the number of trends that influence the industry every so often, you would say his logo again was timeless. The New York subway map didn’t even last a decade, so it’s fair that was timeless. As I mentioned he did design other client work, and that is an understatement, so you could say to define someone on three pieces of work is unfair, but it is a couple pieces of work that you remember someone for, and I think with the variations of results, it can give you an idea of how successful they were.
<br><br>
Once you put that all together, you get an image of the designer. Would I say he was the ‘ultimate timeless designer’? I would say he will be remembered as a significant face in the design industry in decades to come, bear in mind he was significant from the 60’s, and studying him way beyond this essay, his design life has certainly been an education for me. He’s not the only one to create timeless designs, but he is one of them, so I would call him a significant timeless designer.
